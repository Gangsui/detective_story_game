The conversation with Park Hyun-woo played over in his mind as he watched Kim Min-soo's figure disappear into the basement. The preparations were critical, and Lee Jae-hoon needed everything to go smoothly. He shut the window with a decisive thud and turned back to his desk, his face a mask of determination.\n",

      "Meanwhile, Park Hyun-woo had just stepped out into the hallway. He cast a quick glance over his shoulder before pulling out his smartphone. His fingers moved swiftly over the screen as he composed a message to Jung Yoo-jin. The text read, \"Everything is ready now. We will proceed as planned at the specified time.\" He hit send and pocketed the phone, a hint of a smirk playing on his lips. With the message sent, the wheels were now in motion, and there was no turning back.\n",

      "After a moment, Lee Jae-hoon turned away from the window and moved to his desk. He opened a drawer and pulled out a thick folder. Flipping it open, you could see it was filled with documents, though the details were too small to make out from your vantage point. He began to sift through the papers, occasionally pausing to make notes in the margins.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, outside the study, you could hear the faint echo of footsteps in the hallway. Park Hyun-woo was likely making his way towards another part of the mansion, his earlier actions suggesting he had his own plans to execute.\n",
