      "Welcome to the Detective Story Game. In this interactive narrative, you assume the role of a detective trying to either prevent a murder or uncover the murderer’s identity within a limited time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Time will start at 0 minutes and can go up to 50 minutes. You have 3 total attempts (timelines) to solve the case. Every time you exhaust 3 actions, the available time decreases by 10 minutes (e.g., 0–50 minutes → 0–40 minutes → 0–30 minutes).\n",
      "\n",
      "You can move to different locations in the mansion, talk to various characters, and inspect objects to gather clues. Each action you take will advance the story and time. You must be strategic in choosing locations and interacting with characters to find critical evidence and solve the mystery before time runs out.\n",
      "\n",
      "Your goal:\n",
      "- Identify the killer or prevent the murder before the allotted time expires.\n",

      "Story: Lee Jae-hoon looked up from the stack of business documents he was organizing, his eyes narrowing slightly as you approached. He had been meticulously going over a contract, his smile suggesting a sense of satisfaction with whatever deal he had just closed.\n",

      "\"Mr. Lee,\" you began, \"I need to ask you about the missing key.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lee Jae-hoon's expression remained calm, but there was a flicker of something—perhaps annoyance or caution—in his eyes. Before he could respond, Park Hyun-woo, his secretary, entered the study. He glanced between you and Lee Jae-hoon, his face carefully neutral.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"What key are you referring to?\" Lee Jae-hoon finally asked, his tone measured.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The key to the mansion's safe,\" you replied, watching both men closely for any signs of deception. \"It's gone missing, and I need to know if either of you know anything about it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Lee Jae-hoon leaned back in his chair, interlacing his fingers. \"I assure you, I have no idea where the key is. It should be exactly where it always is.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Park Hyun-woo, standing beside Lee Jae-hoon, shifted slightly. \"I checked the safe last night, and everything was in order,\" he said smoothly. \"Perhaps someone else has taken it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "As the tension in the room grew thicker, you couldn't help but notice Park Hyun-woo's subtle glance towards the contract on the desk. Was there something more to this document exchange than met the eye?\n",
      "\n",
      "Just then, Jung Yoo-jin stormed into the study, her face flushed with anger. \"If we proceed with this contract, it will be a huge loss for our company!\" she exclaimed, holding a stack of documents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lee Jae-hoon's smile vanished. \"What are you talking about, Yoo-jin?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Ignoring him, Jung Yoo-jin turned to you. \"You need to find that key. Everything depends on it.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Summary: At 0 minutes, you asked Lee Jae-hoon about the missing key in the 1st floor study. Lee Jae-hoon and Park Hyun-woo both denied knowing its whereabouts, but tension was evident. Jung Yoo-jin interrupted, demanding the key be found urgently due to its importance to a critical contract.\n"
