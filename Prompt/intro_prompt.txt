[Game Start Notice]

Welcome to the Detective Story Game. In this interactive narrative, you assume the role of a detective trying to either prevent a murder or uncover the murderer’s identity within a limited time.

Time will start at 0 minutes and can go up to 50 minutes. You have 3 total attempts (timelines) to solve the case. Every time you exhaust 3 actions, the available time decreases by 10 minutes (e.g., 0–50 minutes → 0–40 minutes → 0–30 minutes).

You can move to different locations in the mansion, talk to various characters, and inspect objects to gather clues. Each action you take will advance the story and time. You must be strategic in choosing locations and interacting with characters to find critical evidence and solve the mystery before time runs out.
